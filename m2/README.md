# Introduction to Python for networking with Paramiko
Paramiko is the lowest common denominator for SSH-based operations
of any kind when using Python. In this project, Paramiko is used
as an SSH client to communicate with network devices using the
basic "send command, get feedback" mechanism.

Unfortunately, Paramiko is where many network engineers *stop*
learning about network automation, but in reality it is only
the beginning. Its limitations will become obvious in this project.
