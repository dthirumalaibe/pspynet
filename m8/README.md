# Writing production-grade code
This module introduces some supplementary tools that professional
programmers use to maintain their Python projects. This includes
linters, code formatters, error checking, and more.

Note that some files contained in this folder will be demonstrated
at a higher level so that the entire project can be checked. This
includes linter rc files and Makefiles.
