# Python Parsing and Unit Testing
This module steps away from network devices briefly to cover two
critical topics.

Regular expressions (regex) are used to extract
data from text blobs and store them as structured data for use
elsewhere. This is a complex topic in Python worthy of its own
discussion.

Additionally, this project is extensively tested using `pytest`,
a popular unit testing framework. This ensures our parsers work
correctly.
